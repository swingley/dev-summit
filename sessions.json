One of the design requirements of the ETL was that it could be run on a regular basis.  Although the majority of the tools have been automated in Python, it still takes several days to run them serially. As part of a multipronged approach to reduce the ETL runtime, the City is developing a geoprocessing pool, composed of a Python process pool and a Networkx directional graph.  The process pool allows jobs to be executed in parallel.  The module developed resolves some of the issues with using geoprocessing tools and process pools, specifically pickling custom toolbox tools and arcpy Result objects.  The directional graph allows the tool's dependencies to be modeled, keeping track of which tools can be run in parallel, and which ones must be run serially.  Furthermore, the Networkx graph package supports critical path analysis.  By storing the typical runtime of a tool, jobs can be executed starting with the most critical jobs first, reducing the overall runtime by optimizing the execution order.","conferenceID":"62","RowIdentity":"248"},{"offeringID":"4634","sessionID":"3039","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"3/11/2014 1:30:00 PM","endDate":"3/11/2014 2:00:00 PM","dateID":"20140311","startDay":"11","startHour":"13","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"3","startYear":"2014","endDay":"11","endHour":"14","endMinute":"0","endMonth":"3","endYear":"2014","sessionTitle":"Deploying iOS Apps","eventTypeDescription":"Demo Theater Presentation","eventTypeID":"27","room":"Demo Theater 1 - Oasis 1  ","floor":"1","xPoint":"-12973016.0852","yPoint":"4005434.2201","contacts":" Albert Pascual - Esri","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","tracks":"269,272,275,280","supertracks":"1","sessionDescription":"Attend this demo theater to learn about techniques, options, and best practices for deploying your iOS app to Apple's App Store or your enterprise.","conferenceID":"62","RowIdentity":"34"},{"offeringID":"4635","sessionID":"3245","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"3/11/2014 2:30:00 PM","endDate":"3/11/2014 3:30:00 PM","dateID":"20140311","startDay":"11","startHour":"14","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"3","startYear":"2014","endDay":"11","endHour":"15","endMinute":"30","endMonth":"3","endYear":"2014","sessionTitle":"Using the File Geodatabase API","eventTypeDescription":"Demo Theater Presentation","eventTypeID":"27","room":"Demo Theater 1 - Oasis 1  ","floor":"1","xPoint":"-12973016.0852","yPoint":"4005434.2201","contacts":" David Sousa - Esri, Lance Shipman - Esri","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","tracks":"","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"This session will review and demo the file geodatabase API, a free C++ API for the file geodatabase.

What to do when those different answers depends on user preferences over “logical” rules? it is clear, you should do it. It is not easy to include those uncertain decisions and user criteria, it is necessary to use computational intelligence - CI  methods that handle them, and integrate them to a traditional geo-process, result is your own “intelligent” geoprocess. Public transport users in Bogotá not always ask for a traditional shortest path, sometimes they want the more comfortable, safe or cheap route, even if it is not the shortest, criteria applied depends on their own beliefs and those are just possible if they are massively collected. Supposing that Bogota’s new transport system collects this big amounts of data, next step is composed by the analysis of user preferences via CI, and the adjustment of Esri’s traditional routing processes to include those additional parameters. Available ArcGIS API tools made possible the enhancement of geo-processes including additional and not traditional parameters like CI models results. The development include tests of different CI models to identify public transport user preferences, the extension of multimodal shortest path geo-process of Esri ArcGIS tools using ArcPY to include additional parameters and wrap all those results up in a new geoprocessing tool. ArcGIS tools are used in many analysis process and is possible to use them in additional situations using API’s and external components to improve them. The integration of tools made in this exercise shows alternatives for developers that looks for alternative processes of data analysis, this is just one of those multiple options that are oriented to the massive data analysis, and could be understood as an step to integration between GIS and Big Data analysis, so the results are very important for professionals that are supporting the development of future GIS based business.

For the most popular and controversial issues of the day, there exists a set of value-neutral terms (or as neutral as possible) which journalists use in order to report and explain without bias. These terms are often shunned by individuals with strong opinions on the matter at hand, instead preferring more colorful terminology for greater emotional impact. The use of these key words and phrases by people in a specific location may indicate the general political beliefs of that population, when taken in aggregate. The Dallas/Fort Worth area was used to test this hypothesis. Using Python, I wrote a script that searched Twitter’s history for a series of biased terms alongside their neutral counterparts, e.g.: “Obamacare” and “affordable care act.” The goal was to determine if areas with high rates of left-leaning language voted for President Obama and areas with high rates of right-leaning language voted for Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. Perhaps the most significant setback in this endeavor was Twitter’s recent decision to discontinue the ability create new “places” with customized boundaries. The location parameter for each search was therefore restricted to Twitter’s currently existing place definitions that best fit the granularity of election results.

This is great news as it broadens opportunities for sharing data and provides a fully functional database to use when creating tools, especially in Python.  However, there has been little emphasis on the fact that Esri supports two different geometry storage options.  The two options are Spatialite and Esri’s geometry storage.  How do you decide which option is best for you?  It is clear that if interoperability with other platforms is a priority, then Spatialite is the best choice.  In this presentation, we will explore the performance of these geometry storage options along side a file geodatabase to determine how choosing SQLite will affect you.","conferenceID":"62","RowIdentity":"162"},{"offeringID":"4842","sessionID":"3148","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"3/11/2014 6:30:00 PM","endDate":"3/11/2014 8:30:00 PM","dateID":"20140311","startDay":"11","startHour":"18","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"3","startYear":"2014","endDay":"11","endHour":"20","endMinute":"30","endMonth":"3","endYear":"2014","sessionTitle":"Showcase at Night","eventTypeDescription":"Conference Activity","eventTypeID":"19","room":"Oasis 1 & 2  ","floor":"1","xPoint":"-12973016.0852","yPoint":"4005434.2201","contacts":"","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","tracks":"","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"","conferenceID":"62","RowIdentity":"111"},{"offeringID":"4897","sessionID":"3171","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"3/11/2014 6:30:00 PM","endDate":"3/11/2014 8:30:00 PM","dateID":"20140311","startDay":"11","startHour":"18","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"3","startYear":"2014","endDay":"11","endHour":"20","endMinute":"30","endMonth":"3","endYear":"2014","sessionTitle":"Showcase at Night","eventTypeDescription":"Onsite Services","eventTypeID":"15","room":"Oasis 1 & 2  ","floor":"1","xPoint":"-12973016.0852","yPoint":"4005434.2201","contacts":"","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","tracks":"0","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"","conferenceID":"62","RowIdentity":"126"},{"offeringID":"5087","sessionID":"3007","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"3/11/2014 6:45:00 PM","endDate":"3/11/2014 7:15:00 PM","dateID":"20140311","startDay":"11","startHour":"18","startMinute":"45","startMonth":"3","startYear":"2014","endDay":"11","endHour":"19","endMinute":"15","endMonth":"3","endYear":"2014","sessionTitle":"Authoring Great Web Maps","eventTypeDescription":"Demo Theater Presentation","eventTypeID":"27","room":"Demo Theater 1 - Oasis 1  ","floor":"1","xPoint":"-12973016.0852","yPoint":"4005434.2201","contacts":" Bernie Szukalski - Esri","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","tracks":"247,264,265","supertracks":"1","sessionDescription":"","conferenceID":"62","RowIdentity":"228"},{"offeringID":"4843","sessionID":"3149","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"3/11/2014 7:00:00 PM","endDate":"3/11/2014 8:30:00 PM","dateID":"20140311","startDay":"11","startHour":"19","startMinute":"0","startMonth":"3","startYear":"2014","endDay":"11","endHour":"20","endMinute":"30","endMonth":"3","endYear":"2014","sessionTitle":"Lightning Talks","eventTypeDescription":"Conference Activity","eventTypeID":"19","room":"Demo Theater 2 - Oasis 1  ","floor":"1","xPoint":"-12973016.0852","yPoint":"4005434.2201","contacts":"","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","tracks":"","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"","conferenceID":"62","RowIdentity":"112"},{"offeringID":"4639","sessionID":"3008","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"3/11/2014 7:15:00 PM","endDate":"3/11/2014 7:45:00 PM","dateID":"20140311","startDay":"11","startHour":"19","startMinute":"15","startMonth":"3","startYear":"2014","endDay":"11","endHour":"19","endMinute":"45","endMonth":"3","endYear":"2014","sessionTitle":"Customizing Story Map Web Apps","eventTypeDescription":"Demo Theater Presentation","eventTypeID":"27","room":"Demo Theater 1 - Oasis 1  ","floor":"1","xPoint":"-12973016.0852","yPoint":"4005434.2201","contacts":" Jon Bowen - Esri, Stephen Sylvia - Esri","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","tracks":"243,247,265","supertracks":"1","sessionDescription":"Esri has created a series of story map apps that combine web maps, multimedia content, and engaging user experiences to tell stories about the world.

Our current prototype allows for spatial and temporal aggregation of multiple datasets into a single one, and also provides a separate function to view temporal changes and trends from this newly created dataset.  Additionally, our add-in allows for the use of R’s panel-linear modeling abilities and random forest classification to analyze trends and causal relations across multiple epochs and varying spatial scales. Finally, the plugin is designed to support the addition of new R-based analytical methods through a generalized form-based process within ArcGIS.","conferenceID":"62","RowIdentity":"148"},{"offeringID":"4911","sessionID":"3188","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"3/12/2014 1:00:00 PM","endDate":"3/12/2014 6:00:00 PM","dateID":"20140312","startDay":"12","startHour":"13","startMinute":"0","startMonth":"3","startYear":"2014","endDay":"12","endHour":"18","endMinute":"0","endMonth":"3","endYear":"2014","sessionTitle":"User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) Summit","eventTypeDescription":"Conference Activity","eventTypeID":"19","room":"Santa Rosa/San Jacinto  ","floor":"1","xPoint":"-12973087.919","yPoint":"4005203.8405","contacts":"","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","tracks":"","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"Explore the latest in visual design, interaction, information architecture, and user experience.

Only the voice of the Lorax could speak on behalf of the trees needs. Similar to the Lorax, The Arizona Game and Fish Department Landowner Relations Program (LRP) also speaks on behalf of the tree’s needs, because trees are what wildlife needs (among other things). LRP partners with locals of the private land, to implement habitat stewardship and recreational access projects, and give wildlife, and the land, a hand…(enough with the rhymes). The large amount of private landowners and projects throughout the state, however, present many project management challenges to the LRP. The question arose, “How can we best target areas for future projects, while effectively tracking past projects?” The answer to this question was of course, design project management in GIS. Each project usually consists of a variety of spatial features with different geometries, such as drinkers (point), fence-lines (line), and grassland restoration areas (polygon) to name a few. In addition, each of these features need to somehow be related to non-spatial data, such as project funding amounts, and landowner contacts.The development of some kind of spatially enabled project management site, accessible statewide, became a necessity. The Lorax-like LRP, then also materialized into a project management ArcGIS web application, the LORAX (Land Owner Relations Accomplishments Xplorer). The LORAX was built on the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, and utilizes Enterprise Geodatabases to allow Feature Service editing capabilities. In this presentation, we will present how the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, and Enterprise Geodatabase technology, can transform folder structures and spreadsheets into a powerful project management site, built in GIS. As part of this presentation we will show how feature services and relationship classes can be leveraged to allow multiple users to input and edit spatial features, standalone table records, and relationships.

Not only has Flex become obsolete and been replaced with HTML5/JavaScript, the design of applications has had to change as well. Fancy moveable windows now need to be static and more informative while the look of the applications still needs to be appealing and easy to navigate.  Smart phones have smaller screens but applications have to look “exactly like on a big screen monitor”.  Applications still need to be map centric.

HTML5 has become one of the most popular technologies to develop web components in the past couple of years. The ability to have most of the tools that developers need, without requiring additional plugins, makes this technology ideally suited as a standard for web development. In our company, after using Silverlight extensively for developing our GIS SharePoint components, we decided to migrate it to HTML5.  To provide a better experience for developers, there were some challenges we had to sort out. After working under an objects oriented paradigm for so long, one of the major challenges was on how to provide a similar code structure when using a loose typing language such as JavaScript.  By using DOJO, we were able to solve this code structuring dilemma, which also simplified the migration process from .NET to HTML5/JavaScript. It gave us the ability to develop classes, widgets and use objects as we were used to do.When it comes to provide GIS capabilities for our component, the Esri JavaScript API gave us all the tools needed to ensure basic and advanced support for GIS workflows in our SharePoint component. Our portal requires some common SharePoint capabilities such as WebParts communication, configuration packaging, and generic message type’s availability, among others. By using an extended .Net WebPart communication framework, and our own configuration schemas, we were able to provide all this functionalities. Also, implementing Esri geo-processing services, as well as the DOJO widgets life cycle and jQuery helped our migration process to be successful. The use of geo-processing services was a key to handle big spatial sets of data on the server side. Another major challenge we faced is supporting secured services and accessing to spatial data from different data sources. The Esri JavaScript API gave us the necessary tools to deal with it. We were able to consume data from OData standard data sources, ArcGIS Server, Shapefiles, CSV files, OGC WMS services and ArcGIS online.","conferenceID":"62","RowIdentity":"151"},{"offeringID":"4927","sessionID":"3209","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"3/12/2014 3:00:00 PM","endDate":"3/12/2014 3:30:00 PM","dateID":"20140312","startDay":"12","startHour":"15","startMinute":"0","startMonth":"3","startYear":"2014","endDay":"12","endHour":"15","endMinute":"30","endMonth":"3","endYear":"2014","sessionTitle":"Google Glass and Esri - Yes I Can Haz the Maps!","eventTypeDescription":"User Presentation","eventTypeID":"33","room":"Mesquite B  ","floor":"1","xPoint":"-12973034.6071","yPoint":"4005394.008","contacts":" Christopher Moravec - Eagle Information Mapping","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","tracks":"","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"When I got my Google Glass a few months ago, I thought it would be really cool to start integrating it into things that I do everyday, and what I do everyday is Esri.

The Route Logs have gone through an evolution, starting out as hand-drawn logs, to being generated with CADD, followed by a VBA-based application within ArcGIS 9.3.  Our goal was to create a new automated system “in house” that could be maintained internally and evolve with the data, workflows, and user needs. The outcome is a completely re-engineered Route Log System consisting of an ArcMap template and a suite of Python scripts driving data pre-processing and Route Log production. Notable features that helped overcome the challenges faced during development include:  1) scripts preventing overposting of critical labels, 2) scripts integrating data from SDE databases, geodatabases, shapefiles, and Excel documents, and 3) scripts handling a variety of non-standard route and data scenarios that required additional pre-processing in order to leverage Esri’s Linear Referencing Tools.","conferenceID":"62","RowIdentity":"152"},{"offeringID":"4674","sessionID":"3282","offeringCount":"2","levelID":"2","startDate":"3/12/2014 4:00:00 PM","endDate":"3/12/2014 5:00:00 PM","dateID":"20140312","startDay":"12","startHour":"16","startMinute":"0","startMonth":"3","startYear":"2014","endDay":"12","endHour":"17","endMinute":"0","endMonth":"3","endYear":"2014","sessionTitle":"ArcGIS and Ruby: Making Web Development Fun and Easy","eventTypeDescription":"Esri Technical Session","eventTypeID":"37","room":"Mojave Learning Center ","floor":"1","xPoint":"","yPoint":"","contacts":" Kenichi Nakamura - Esri, Jason Wieringa - Esri","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","tracks":"","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"Ruby is an increasingly popular programming language to effectively build web applications with declarative and easy-to-maintain code.

Snyder, a highly regarded expert in map projections, wrote that “working with projections still strikes fear in the hearts of many trained cartographers and geographers.” Twenty years later, this fear has not disappeared despite new mapmaking technology. The selection criteria for map projections are a mystery to most GIS users. Map projections ought to be selected based on the extent of the geographic area shown by the map and the required deformation properties. This presentation will introduce a new web based tool that facilitates the selection of projections. It will also show how cartographers can apply projections not included in ArcGIS to their vector data using Python scripting. Finally, it will demonstrate how the selection of map projections can be automated for web maps using Adaptive Composite Map Projections. This adaptive composite seamlessly transitions between multiple projections as the user changes the scale or the area shown on the map. HTML5 Canvas and WebGL are used in an example web map for on-the-fly projection and rasterization that illustrates this concept.","conferenceID":"62","RowIdentity":"153"},{"offeringID":"4929","sessionID":"3192","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"3/12/2014 4:30:00 PM","endDate":"3/12/2014 5:00:00 PM","dateID":"20140312","startDay":"12","startHour":"16","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"3","startYear":"2014","endDay":"12","endHour":"17","endMinute":"0","endMonth":"3","endYear":"2014","sessionTitle":"A Simple and Straightforward Tool for First Responders","eventTypeDescription":"User Presentation","eventTypeID":"33","room":"Mesquite B  ","floor":"1","xPoint":"-12973034.6071","yPoint":"4005394.008","contacts":" Luke Wenschhof - Fairport Municipal Commission","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","tracks":"","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"In New York State, fire departments and ambulance squads have traditionally broken up their districts into “boxes” for dispatching purposes.  When an emergency call is received, a page or text will be sent out to responders with the address of the call and the box in which that address is located.  Many of these agencies are small and still use paper maps with access limited to the station house and vehicles.  A student in Dr. Edward Pultar’s Mobile GIS course in the University of Southern California’s GIST Master’s Program, who also produces map products for emergency response agencies, used Esri’s Android SDK to develop a simple means of getting up-to-date emergency data into the hands of these first responders.The initial emergency contact data is crucial, but the information package in which it is delivered is just as critical.  The information package must be accessible to users of all software skill levels and enable them to quickly access the time-sensitive data needed to put out fires and save lives.  The Android platform and Esri’s Android SDK present the perfect means to create this package and deliver this data as it is needed and in a mobile format. This Android app was built through direct consultation with first responders, with what they want to see in mind.  The mobile app makes use of a lightweight information package that consumes map data housed in ArcGIS Online as well as Esri’s World Imagery and Geocoding map services. By harnessing these Esri map services and Android’s native GPS capabilities the app allows users, firemen in this case, to pre-plan on the way to the scene of the emergency and to make split-second decisions on-scene (situational awareness) by being able to instantly move the map to the call location and locate water sources such as hydrants, pools, and ponds, and even more potential hazards in the area. This app and its development take advantage of the many free resources available for the Android OS.

For this they wanted to use Autonomy Idol, which did not have geo-spatial functionality in the version that was available at the time. An additional requirement was that the information could also be found by internet search engines.The challenge was to find a way for the search engines to index the information from the spatial data and metadata delivered via OGC-interfaces such as CSW, WFS and WFS-G. If you point a search engine to a metadata catalog or gazetteer, it will not be able to extract the information on the individual sets of metadata or spatial objects. We tackled this by creating ETL-processes that connect to the OGC-service, iterate through all objects, and extract the information that is relevant for the search or display. This information was then written to HTML or XML-files optimized for indexing and xml sitemaps were created to reference the files. For the client-side programming we used the Esri JS API. This was an obvious choice because we had to display geoservices and JSON objects. The JS API also proved convenient when we implemented a mobile version of the geoportal. At the time of implementation we were not so sure that our approach would actually work well with internet search engines – mostly because we did not know much about how the individual search engines will find and prioritize the hits. Now we are happy to say that it worked! When using Google for searching for specific information from the geoportal, the information will usually show up as the first hit.","conferenceID":"62","RowIdentity":"154"},{"offeringID":"4734","sessionID":"2973","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"4","startDate":"3/12/2014 5:30:00 PM","endDate":"3/12/2014 6:30:00 PM","dateID":"20140312","startDay":"12","startHour":"17","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"3","startYear":"2014","endDay":"12","endHour":"18","endMinute":"30","endMonth":"3","endYear":"2014","sessionTitle":"Extending ArcGIS GeoEvent Processor with New Processors","eventTypeDescription":"Esri Technical Session","eventTypeID":"37","room":"Primrose C/D  ","floor":"1","xPoint":"-12973048.2548","yPoint":"4005530.7291","contacts":" Vlad Plechnoy - Esri, Patrick Hill - Esri","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","tracks":"141,279,291,293,297","supertracks":"1","sessionDescription":"","conferenceID":"62","RowIdentity":"87"},{"offeringID":"4661","sessionID":"3279","offeringCount":"1","levelID":"2","startDate":"3/12/2014 5:30:00 PM","endDate":"3/12/2014 6:30:00 PM","dateID":"20140312","startDay":"12","startHour":"17","startMinute":"30","startMonth":"3","startYear":"2014","endDay":"12","endHour":"18","endMinute":"30","endMonth":"3","endYear":"2014","sessionTitle":"Building Mapping Solutions with Esri Open Source Projects","eventTypeDescription":"Esri Technical Session","eventTypeID":"37","room":"Smoketree A - E  ","floor":"1","xPoint":"-12972937.6107","yPoint":"4005378.6543","contacts":" Allan Laframboise - Esri","presenters":"","paperTitle":"","tracks":"","supertracks":"","sessionDescription":"This session will explore how to develop applications that consume ArcGIS technology and services through different open-source solutions and frameworks such as Esri Leaflet, Terraformer, GeoServices-JS, Bootstrap-Map-JS, and others.

However, the calendar provides no spatial view for scheduling activities.  This presentation details my efforts to create such a view.  I use various Python modules (Beautiful Soup, XML Tree, Regular Expressions, etc.) to access and parse resource RSS feeds, and ArcPy to convert the data to an ArcGIS format.  A scheduled task runs the Python scripts, at given intervals, every day to ensure information passed to ArcGIS is up-to-date. Once schedule information is successfully converted to an ArcGIS format, SQL Query Layers are utilized to create mapping services by resource type.   The mapping services are then published to ArcGIS Server for viewing.Esri’s JavaScript API provides the framework for the front-end application, which enables the test director and all of WFF to access a spatial representation of scheduled activities—including graphical views and data queries.  My presentation will unfold the entire process and demonstrate the front-end application. Not one of the well-known NASA bases, WFF is nestled on the eastern shore of Virginia.  WFF is operated by NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center in support of space technology, earth science technology, and aeronautical research.  The core of activities throughout the facility are conducted on the Wallops Research Range, which includes a launch range, an aeronautical research airport, radar tracking facilities, data acquisition, and instrumentation systems.

This workshop will focus on web services-based approaches. This presentation will review the use of many of the popular geospatial web service-based protocols from the Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. (OGC), as a means for achieving interoperability. Support for these protocols within the ArcGIS platform will be demonstrated. Over the last few years, with the increased adoption of Web 2.0 technologies, there is an increased interest in using open APIs to target interoperability challenges. In this context, this presentation will discuss the GeoServices REST API Specification—an open specification made available by Esri. Multiple software solutions based on ArcGIS and non-Esri solutions will be used to make the case for using the Open GeoServices REST as a pragmatic RESTful solution for meeting current interoperability challenges.Over the last few years, with the increased adoption of web 2.0 technologies, there is an increased interest in using open API’s to target interoperability challenges.
